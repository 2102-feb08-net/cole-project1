# Galacticat Store Management

This project consists of a fully functioning website running on azure web services that allows managers to view/create order for new or existing customers.  The site features 
easy navigation through clicking on table entries you'd like to view the details for, and offers all required functionality from the project requirements.  For front end styling, 
Bootstrap was used to help lay out the various columns, and also add easy styling to buttons throughout the website.  The backend was done using ASP.net web api.  This api uses
Data Annotations to guarantee that information coming in from the client headed towards my repositories has been validated first to have the correct format.
